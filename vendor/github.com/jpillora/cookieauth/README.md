# cookieauth

Cookie-based Basic-Authentication HTTP middleware for Go (golang). Stores `scrypt(user:pass)` in a cookie. Prevents the need to keep entering basic-auth username and passwords over and over.

### Features

* Simple
* Thread-safe
* Secured using [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt)

### Usage

Get package:

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/cookieauth
```

Quick use:

``` go
handler := http.HandlerFunc(...)
protected := cookieauth.Wrap(handler, "foo", "bar")
http.ListenAndServe(":3000", protected)
```

Customized use:

``` go
handler := http.HandlerFunc(...)

ca := cookieauth.New()
ca.SetID("session_token")
ca.SetUserPass("foo", "bar")
ca.SetExpiry(2 * time.Hour)
ca.SetLogger(log.New(os.Stdout, "", log.LstdFlags))

protected := ca.Wrap(handler)

http.ListenAndServe(":3000", protected)
```

Successful logins are hashed using scrypt and stored in a cookie.
